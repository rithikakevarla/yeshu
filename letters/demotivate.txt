When u are demotivated

Hiii, ik that you won't let me know when you are sad or when u are demotivated. 
Ik that you try to get better on your own but I'm here for you.

Just take some time, go out on a walk listen to music and feel better. 
Think of all the good times you did sooooo well in exams. 
Think of the times where you actually enjoyed studying, times 
when you put in so much efforts and when you got deserving results. 
Think of all the times you scored well. Even if it's as 
small as a unit test. Koncham confidence osthadhi that we did well 
and we are capable of dng even more better in future ani. 

I believe in you, I'm sure you believe in yourself too. 
Just take a break forget all the wowiwioekdkdk stuff on your mind. 
And stop comparing yourself to others. Ik that you don't but you are doing so good on your own pace. 

Think of what all you need to do to improve in this particular aspect and then work on them slowly. 

Even if you try to get better by 1% everyday. It's a really big progress compared to doing so much in just 1 day. Right?

We both are happy and dng good, all we have to focus on right now is studies and I'm sure we'll do that. 

Get back soon yesh. Call me if you want to talk and feel better pleaseðŸ¥º

Prove me right yesh, prove me that YOU CAN DO IT.
