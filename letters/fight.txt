When we fight

Hiiii, ik I might have fucked up and got mad at you,
Or you might have done smtg and I might have got hurt. 
It's not about who's fault it is..but let's not hurt each other. Let's not say rude hurtful things and 
Take time to understand the situation better and to sort this out in the best way.

I just want you to listen to what I have on my mind when I'm hurt, 
and I'll be completely fine.
I'm sorry ik that I couldn't be fine but IM TRYINGGGGGGGGG MY BEST right now. 
I'll be completely fine if I'm given the time and if u listen to me. 

Just listen, understand and then pls say your pov. 

And ik that you are TRYINGGGGGGGGG so much from your side too and it 
shows yesh, it's clear that you are trying to be gentle, that you are 
trying to understand me better, and to not have issues btw us. 

It's 19th Jan today, it's ur bday and the last time we faught was on 1st 
Jan we haven't had any such situations like that so far. We dint argue not fight, it's a win ig?

Let's be happy kanna. 
Lets both try in the same way forever. We both know that we only fight
if we are far from each other. Once we are together we won't have such issues 
anymore. Let's just keep getting better.

And everytime we fight let's remember that the main thing is not to sort. 
But just to sort completely, so that we won't face the same situation again.

And ik I might say rude things IM SOOOOO SORRY BEFORE HAND. 

I love you sooo much. 

As I said 
I would rather fight 29289393939 times and sort it out with u than be with someone else.
